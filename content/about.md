My name is Cristián Donoso. I am a Chilean software engineer currently based in Montréal, Quebéc,
Canada.

I complain a lot about programming (trying to diminish actually), but overall I consider myself a
fluffly, easy-going guy.

I currently work at [Haven Studios](https://www.havenstudios.com) as a Gameplay Programmer, after
working there as the [Cloud Team Lead (infrastructure lead)](https://havenstudios.com/en/blog/haven-kafe-cristian-donoso) when the studio started.

I have worn many hats in my career: Rails webdev, worked on a circuit simulation suite @ [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/custom-design-platform/custom-compiler.html),
worked on Google Cloud, Fuchsia and Stadia @ [Google](https://www.google.com/), before landing at my current role.


Current interests: Game & Engine Development, (Neo)Vim, Golang.
